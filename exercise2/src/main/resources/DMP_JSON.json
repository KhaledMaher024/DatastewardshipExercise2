    "description": "The resulting relationship is one of the most important objectives of the project. The relationship is to increase the family income in the United States with a decrease in the death rate of children aged 1 to 19 years from 1953 to 2015. In conclusion, this relationship can be confirmed in the future if household income increases. It can be applied to other countries",
